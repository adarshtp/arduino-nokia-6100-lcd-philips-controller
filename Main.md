Library for Nokia 6100 breakout board with Philips controller

# Introduction #

I have searched internet for a working driver for my Nokia 6100 LCD connected to Arduino, but didn't able to get any library. All I got is a .pde file which has the full data from http://www.gravitech.us/13secogrlcd.html

It was a huge file. Hence I went to arduino library tutorial on how to make a library and converted the code into a library.

Its a simple library which will print random colored text and graphics onto the LCD screen.
